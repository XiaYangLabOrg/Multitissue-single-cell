This code depository refers to the code associated with publication Multitissue single-cell analysis reveals differential cellular and molecular sensitivity between fructose and high-fat high-sucrose diets (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725004619)

The seurat object for the analysis is too large to be uploaded to github. The metadata, expression and tSNE data is available at single cell portal SCP1403 (intestine), SCP1404 (liver), SCP1405 (adipose), SCP1406 (hypothalamus) and SCP1407 (hypothalamus neurons).
