Due to several iterations of this research project. The code at this stage is an iteration across multiple stages. Some earlier parts might contain changed sample names/folder names, may not be runnable at other environments and will need extreme caution to interpret. The code at this stage is for demonstration of what functions were used to generate result and figures only. We are working on improving the code readability/transferability but completion time is not guaranteed

The seurat object for the analysis is too large to be uploaded to github. The metadata, expression and tSNE data is available at single cell portal SCP1403 (intestine), SCP1404 (liver), SCP1405 (adipose), SCP1406 (hypothalamus) and SCP1407 (hypothalamus neurons).
